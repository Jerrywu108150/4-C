receiver App of 4-C

## Run this project on flutter
### Step 1: prepare edge device(the following items are what we need)
1. Raspberry pi 4
2. RPi Camera V2
3. ESP-S3-12K
4. Darlington High Power Transistor
5. SparkFun 2-screws Terminal Block
6. Slide Switch
7. SparkFun 20x2 Female Pin Header
8. 12v 5A power supply
9. Jumper wires (generic)
### Step 2: install linux system in raspberry pi 4
